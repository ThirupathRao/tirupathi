This is'nt about the kid, Its about their parents.

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">I happened to spend some time with a kid today while visiting the hospital in the evening. <b><i>Chotu</i></b>, that's what her brother calls her. She carries big pleading eyes, and trust me they are very hard to ignore.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Did you ever remember your mum telling you not to put your hands on the ground back then when you were a kid? It seems like her mum did not.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">She wore a torn dress full of dust on it and even on her hair. She has no clue why she is on the road, running behind people asking for money and food.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">She is probably doing this:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">For her next meal or</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Not to get beaten by her parents for not bringing the money or</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">she might be just habituated with her routine.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">At that age, what you have done? What I have done?</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">We have gone to school, studied, played with friends, fought with friends, and even been beaten by parents for obvious childish things. That's what kids suppose to do.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">But what is she doing now? She probably wouldn't know, that's not what she had to do at that age. I just wish her to know that it is not the actual world. That is the world her parents have created for her selfishly.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">I believe this will not stop here. By the time she realizes what she is doing for her living, she might probably fall in love with some random stranger or her parents might get her married. And the same story continues with her kids as well unless the random stranger is well ever of what he is doing for his kids.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Do you see what is happening here? Chotu's parents are not only destroying her childhood but rather her life. And It would take generations and a miracle to repair this damage.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This might earn them the next meal, but what about the next generation? Why are they even doing this to themselves?</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Is this because they are homeless and the only thing they care about is having a meal for today?</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Is this because this is the easy way to earn money?</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Is this because this is what they know?</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Is this because society did not accept them or gave them work for a living?</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Is this because they are disabled?</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Whatever might be the reason that kid has every right to be a kid.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Nothing changed in the last few years, to be frank, I feel like Chotu's like parents have mastered the skill of fetching, '<i>I would rather insist the word stealing</i>' the money from people.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">I have no clue how to help them. A few years back I tried once but that not only didn't help the kid but rather it has done more damage to her. Maybe I shouldn't have bought the toy which she was asking for. Her Parents sold that to the same guy from whom I have bought it, for a lesser price. I cannot even think of what she might have gone through at that time and even in her life.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As the time passes looking at these kids daily on the way to work and thinking about their parents I feel no pain, not anymore. Maybe I have become a hard-hearted person. Maybe that's how we suppose to be.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">I just wish Chotu not to shape up like their parents.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">On the flip side of this complete story, I have met and seen amazing people who are single parents, differently-abled, and even people with lots of emotional and financial baggage thrive to have a better life for themselves most importantly for their kids.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">I wonder what is that these amazing people have and they don't.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">I just hope, I/You provide support to these people who come across our lives. It always doesn't have to be financial. Sometimes just listening to them or giving a word or even simple showing a big smile would make a lot of difference.</span></p>
